## 🤔 What is InstallKit?

**InstallKit** helps you install all your favorite Mac apps at once using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Instead of:
1. Searching for each app online
2. Downloading installers one by one
3. Dragging apps to your Applications folder repeatedly

You can:
1. Pick all the apps you want from InstallKit
2. Copy one command
3. Paste it in Terminal and let Homebrew install everything

Perfect for:
- **Setting up a new Mac** — Get all your apps installed quickly
- **Reinstalling macOS** — Restore your setup without hunting for downloads
- **Sharing your setup** — Send friends a link with your recommended apps

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Browse and Select Apps

1. Go to [installkit.vercel.app](https://installkit.vercel.app)
2. Browse through 200+ popular Mac apps organized by category
3. Check the apps you want to install
4. Copy the generated Homebrew command
5. Paste it in your Terminal

### Option 2: Share Your Existing Setup

Already have a Mac with apps installed via Homebrew? Generate a shareable link with all your apps:

```bash
curl -fsSL installkit.vercel.app/s | bash
```

This scans your installed Homebrew packages and creates a personalized InstallKit link. Use it to:
- **Back up your app list** — Save the link before wiping your Mac
- **Share with others** — Send the link to friends so they can install the same apps
- **Set up another Mac** — Open the link on your new machine and install everything in one go

## 📋 Requirements

You need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed on your Mac. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## ✨ Features

- **200+ Curated Apps** — Popular browsers, dev tools, productivity apps, media players, and more
- **Search** — Quickly find any app by name
- **Homebrew Search** — Can't find an app? Search Homebrew's full catalog of 10,000+ packages
- **Categories** — Browse by type: Browsers, Development, Productivity, Entertainment, etc.
- **Dark Mode** — Easy on the eyes
- **Shareable Links** — Share your app selections with anyone
